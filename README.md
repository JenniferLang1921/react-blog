This app was built using React JS and is hosted on Github pages. I was surprised by how difficult it was to use React-Router when I had not had to work very hard to switch pages on a website before. I am learning a lot about how to use object literals.

Technologies Used: React.js, React-router, Javascript, Date-fns, Github pages, Node.js
